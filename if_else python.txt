Given an integer, , perform the following conditional actions:

If  is odd, print Weird
If  is even and in the inclusive range of  to , print Not Weird
If  is even and in the inclusive range of  to , print Weird
If  is even and greater than , print Not Weird
Input Format

A single line containing a positive integer, .

Constraints

Output Format

Print Weird if the number is weird; otherwise, print Not Weird.





solutions:

n = int(input().strip())
check = {True: "Not Weird", False: "Weird"}

print(check[
        n%2==0 and (
            n in range(2,6) or 
            n > 20)
    ])
I defined a simple dictionary. If the value it gets is true, 
the program prints "Not Weird", and if it's false "Weird" is printed.
Then I simply created a bunch of statements that evaluate to either True or False.



alt solutions:


if __name__ == '__main__':
    n = int(raw_input().strip())
    if n%2==0:
        if(n>=2 and n<=5) or n>20:
            print("Not Weird")
        else:
            print("Weird")
    else:
        print("Weird")
